# üñêÔ∏è Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

Welcome to the **Hand Digit Recognition Using CNN** project!  
This repository provides a complete pipeline to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python. You can train the model, visualize its performance, and deploy a fun interactive web app where you can draw your own digit and get instant predictions!

## üöÄ Features

- üéØ **Accurate CNN Model:** Built with TensorFlow/Keras, trained on MNIST dataset.
- üñºÔ∏è **Interactive Web App:** Draw a digit in your browser and let the model predict it (Streamlit powered).
- üìä **Visualization:** Confusion matrices and prediction heatmaps to understand model performance.
- üíæ **End-to-End Workflow:** From training to deployment, all code and resources included.
- üì¶ **Easy Setup:** All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RubanThinks/hand_digit_recognition_using_cnn.git
cd hand_digit_recognition_using_cnn
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model (Optional)

If you want to retrain the model, simply run:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will train the CNN on the MNIST dataset and save the model as `final.h5`.

### 4. Run the Web App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Draw a digit (0‚Äì9) in the box and click **Predict** to see the model's prediction!
